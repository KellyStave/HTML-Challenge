# HTML-Challenge
In this challenge we were asked to scrape the a webpage for Mars data in part one.
First we created a connection to the webpage then used Beautiful soup to scrape the webpage for pertinent text data.
Next we found the title and summary for each article listed on the Mars page.
In part 2 of this challenge we used Beautiful soup to scrape another Mars webpage for information included in a table about Martian days per earth year and the amount of time the Mars Rover was on Mars.
We recreated the table in our jupiter notebook, verified the information types present then determined the following:
  The average low temperature per month and plotted this to a bar graph.
  The warmest and coldest months that were recorded. The third month was coldest while the eigth month was the warmest.
  The average monthly pressure which was also plotted to a bar graph.
  Finally we determined the number of Martian days in an earth year which is 686 by my calculation.
